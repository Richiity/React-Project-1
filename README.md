# About this project

This project was an assignment from my Web Development course to understand how to work with states, hooks and props in react.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` or `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## First page

First page you are met with is the Game Selector drop down. The picture of Anya is for fun *heh* .
This will allow you to select a type of game and its item(s) through `GameSelector.tsx`.

## Sample 1
Sample 1 shows examples of state management through a counter type class in `StackingItem.tsx`
As well as another state management example through a active / inactive bool type in `BinaryItem.tsx`
All of the items can have their states reset with the `reset.tsx` button below.

## Sample 2
Sample 2 continues our examples of state management and using hooks in react. 
In this particular sample, we have an item(s) that can change it's form depending on the selection in `ExclusiveItem.tsx`
The concept was evolving item or upgraded versions of the item.
